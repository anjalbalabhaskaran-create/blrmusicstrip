    description: "\"Our whole intention was that people should feel, on their own, that they want to come and share something with the public — and that it should be appreciated. Let it go on, we thought. A better performance could always come next. That was the most encouraging part of the whole thing, and it wasn't lost on the Commissioner at the time. I've told you about the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Sanghyaan. One day — and of course there were plain-clothes policemen wandering around — but this one man, neatly dressed, walked up just as we were winding up the show, folding cables and packing up. He wanted to know if it was possible for him to come and play next Sunday.\"",

I played the Sarod, and George Orwai played guitar — we had that fusion thing going. It was open to anything. That was the public. It was open to the people. The space was too small for segregation.

There was some kind of curation — if three or four bands wanted to play, either Sunbeam or I or someone else would say, 'Okay, you play first. Let the acoustic people sing.\"",

Even if you told him it wasn't good — or that it was — it didn't really matter. Because he was helping. So many people would come out and appreciate what was happening. That was it. He managed to do it — get a few takes on, not licenses exactly — but to contact people, get the venue ready, get the lighting, even have the cops check the venue. People helped him.

That is actually a negative in people's heads. Anybody can come, then why should I come? You have not put a price on my attendance. Whereas the right answer is, nobody is stopping you to come and we promise you'll be safe. So then how does it matter? I asked several of the bankers, they said make it 200, make it 100. That friction of I paid something will make people come. It's not just a function of, oh there are no spaces, that's why it doesn't happen. Audiences are smaller irrespective of what the price is. And for everything, music actually does better than dance or theatre.\"",

Back then Sunbeam Motha and his friends started this event called the music strip near the King Edward statue by the rocks. It was mostly acoustic in nature and have had a considerable amount of footfall for a music event. Since there was no power nearby, the acoustic nature of the performances wasn't by choice.\"",

People could, if they wanted, with very little interference or permission, gather anywhere. These days, if you just have a small gathering in Cubbon Park, there's a hue and cry. You can picture yourself — Government Park itself was dark. People brought lanterns — petromax lanterns — because there was no power. Batteries would drive the small amps and speakers. Drum kits — without mics. But that was enough. There were a few stage amps which Reynolds used to give us. The whole thing would run just on batteries and petromax lanterns. Families would bring sandwiches and burgers — a small subset of things — and start selling. So it started near the rock.\"",

Why don't they support local musicians? And not the ones who already get support — like film musicians or classical. But musicians who are telling their own stories. And not just musicians — theatre artists, visual artists, filmmakers. These are the stories that are important to support. That's what I mean. Nothing will stop — I'll enjoy that music. It's not about that. But it's also about supporting local ecosystems. And there's this constant post-colonial hangover — which is itself a kind of colonization.\"",
